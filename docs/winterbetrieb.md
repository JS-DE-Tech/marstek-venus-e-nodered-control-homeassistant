# ‚ùÑ Winter Mode ‚Äì Technical Details

The **Winter Mode** optimizes energy behavior during periods of low solar generation.  
It decides between `AUTO` and `PASSIVE` based on PV surplus, grid power, and battery SoC.

## üß† Logic Overview

| Condition | Action | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| PV surplus ‚â§ ‚Äì200 W for ‚â• 30 s | ‚Üí `AUTO` | Allow charging from solar |
| Grid import ‚â• 100 W for ‚â• 30 s and SoC ‚â§ 50 % | ‚Üí `PASSIVE` | Prevent discharging into the house |
| Fast cutoff: SoC < 41 % | ‚Üí `PASSIVE` within 5 s | Protect battery from deep discharge |
| Cooldown 60 s after PASSIVE | Blocks AUTO restart | Avoid oscillations |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters (defaults)

| Variable | Value | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `SURPLUS_START_W` | ‚Äì200 W | PV surplus threshold |
| `SURPLUS_FOR_MS` | 30 000 ms | Hold time before AUTO |
| `VGRID_STOP_W` | 100 W | Grid import threshold |
| `STOP_FOR_MS` | 30 000 ms | Hold time before PASSIVE |
| `STOP_FAST_MS` | 5 000 ms | Quick cutoff below 41 % SoC |
| `PASSIVE_COOLDOWN_MS` | 60 000 ms | Cooldown between mode changes |

## üß© Coordination with Storage Mode

When Storage mode is active (`storage_active=true`),  
the Winter controller **pauses completely** and shows a blue status  
`[PAUSE due to Storage]`.  
After Storage mode (including grace phase) ends, Winter mode resumes automatically.
